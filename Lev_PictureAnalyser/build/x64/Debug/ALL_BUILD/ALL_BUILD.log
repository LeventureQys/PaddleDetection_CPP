  CMake Deprecation Warning at Lev_ModelInfer/CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
    CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
  
  
  
  CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/CMake/share/cmake-3.28/Modules/ExternalProject.cmake:3198 (message):
    The DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP option was not given and policy CMP0135 is
    not set.  The policy's OLD behavior will be used.  When using a URL
    download, the timestamps of extracted files should preferably be that of
    the time of extraction, otherwise code that depends on the extracted
    contents might not be rebuilt if the URL changes.  The OLD behavior
    preserves the timestamps from the archive instead, but this is usually not
    what you want.  Update your project to the NEW behavior or specify the
    DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP option with a value of true to avoid this
    robustness issue.
